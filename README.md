# ionic-e2e-react-webdriverio-appium
Example ReactJS App for Ionic v6 E2E Testing using WebdriverIO and Appium to Test On Device 

### Overview
Looking to integrate e2e testing a an ionic-framework application and the [sample provided by Ionic](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-e2e-example) in written in Angular and it is based on cordova and not capacitor so I have started this project to figure things out

- sample based on the list template provided by ionic
- source code is in react js
- tests currently work in android emulator and in the webbrowser
- This still a work in progress but it is based on latest versions on Ionic and Capacitor so it shoul get on started better than the other sample
- The project hasn't been cleaned up, there are still some artifacts from the original Ionic Project
